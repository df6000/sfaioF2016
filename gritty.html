                        <p>This course introduces students to the concepts, tools and workflows involved in creating digital works of art, with a focus on interactivity and “expanded” tools.  We’ll begin by exploring what is capable using tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, and other oﬀ the shelf solutions, but we will also learn the underlying properties of digital media with an eye towards getting “under the hood” to make deeper and more creative manipulations, mostly using the javascript port of Processing, P5.js. The course will introduce the language of game design, social practices, user experience, and interaction design, and explore concepts in art and art history through the lens of the digital. Students will learn to translate physical gestures and environmental data into responsive experiences, and explore the creation of unique interfaces using sensors, switches and Arduino.</p>

                        <p>The primary work of this course will be done within the context of four major projects, each of which explores a different mode of interactivity.  Although we will mostly be discussing interactive art as a digital medium with some analog antecedents, all of these projects may be done in any medium or combination of mediums.  If a sculpture or a deck of cards is more appropriate than a video game for communicating your idea, then by all means go for it!</p>
